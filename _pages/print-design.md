    excerpt: "As a DJ and lover of cutting rugs, I've been putting on parties and moving the crowd for a more than a decade. The FND SND (think _Found Sound_) event was based in Brooklyn and required all kinds of promotional materials, including flyers, posters, and mixes. The design I devised embraced the vowel-less trend of the moment, with a dash of grit and texture, and some pure vector design approach to the vinyl's lighting and material effect. Texture, typography, and atomsphere are the sounding rods of my visual design work."

    excerpt: "A beat or a mix is not complete unless there are some evocative visuals to accompany the sounds. That's what I believe and I'm sticking to that."
