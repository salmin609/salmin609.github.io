    excerpt: "GPU Skinning speeds up simulating skinning technique, but it's still not enough to rendering 10k+ animating objects. \n\n
    Simulation might can be shared same objects, but rendering animating object is totally different story. \n\n
    For example, if we render object which has 5000+ vertices 100 times, our GPU needs to simulate 500000 vertices which is very heavy work"
